# OTT Platform Case Study
In this case study, there is a problem in front of the OTT platform regarding the decline in the number of people visiting the platform.
Some of the points we would be considering:-
1. Fewer people watching the video.
2. Decrease in marketing spend.
3. Competitive shows i.e IPL/Cricket match
4. Special holidays
5. Twist in story
 
So with the help of regression, we would try to solve the given problem.
